# esolang

Experimentation with esoteric programming languages.

## Brainfuck

Includes a neat interpreter for Brainfuck written in Python.
Supports the `;` command which outputs the value instead of the ASCII character.

## Hylang

Hytak's experimental language. There's no compiler or interpreter yet, as it is still being planned.
